# 🐧 UbuntuOS Portfolio

A fully interactive **Ubuntu-themed developer portfolio** built using **Next.js**, **React**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
It simulates a real operating system with draggable windows, terminal, context menus, apps, and a window manager — all designed to showcase your skills in the most creative way possible.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted a portfolio that felt **alive** — something that captures both my frontend skills and creative expression.  
Instead of a traditional webpage, this project emulates a **mini operating system** to reflect my personality and technical abilities.
